## About

Here is a 100% Android app which checks if your device is running Huawei Harmony "OS" and try to get some class infos using reflect APIs.

## Project for practising

As an android learner, I write this app completely for learning purpose. 

## 100% Android

This app is developed on Android Studio and write completely in Kotlin, utilizing new Android Jetpack components and KTX extensions.

## Harmony OS Interopability with Android

With relection, we can clearly see some `ohos` classes are loaded into Dalvik VM, and they can be inspected using reflect APIs. Yet we are not clear what happened before initiating `Zygote` or, what is outside of the so called "Android compatible" framework.

## About "Homo"

Is merely a homophonic translation for its Chinese name "鸿蒙" :)
